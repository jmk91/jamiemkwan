    body-text: "The 20x20 foot room was filled with over 150 spherical lights, and clad from floor-to-ceiling in mirrored acrylic panels to create the impression of an infinite night sky. Eight at a time, visitors were invited to enter into the space to explore. Open-ended interactions encouraged exploration, and upon discovery of the eight hidden 'trigger' lights, the overall space responded with location-specific music and lighting changes in sync to the audio. <strong>Beyond the visual experience, Ad Astra turned small visitor interactions into large spatial responses.</strong>"
    quote: Once inside the dreamlike (or was I just dreaming?) space, there was a sense of peacefulness amongst those enjoying the aesthetically pleasing, almost otherworldly void we found ourselves a part of.

<p>Ad Astra was an interactive experience that immersed visitors into an infinite night sky and created a quiet — but highly memorable — retreat from a festival known for crowds and all-night adventures across the city. <strong>One of the core goals of the project was to create a simple, photogenic intervention that the general public could immerse themselves within, and as well, become an active participant in a collective experience.</strong></p>
