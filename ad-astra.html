    "body-text": "Ad Astra was an interactive experience that immersed visitors into an infinite night sky and created a quiet — but highly memorable — retreat from a festival known for crowds and all-night adventures across the city. One of the core goals of the project was to create a simple, photogenic intervention that the general public could immerse themselves within, and as well, become an active participant in a collective experience."
