<div class="col-md-8">
  <p>This interactive installation attempted to act as a social mechanism for creative and collaborative interactions amongst artists and policy makers. The symposium had a key focus on the connections, systems and future of our city, so the overall exhibit asked participants: <i>What Can Art Do For You?</i></p>

  <p><b><span class="theme-color">'Critical Play'</span></b> emerged as a core concept as a result of the design process. The conversations that occur in serendipitous moments of play were weaved into various aspects of the installation: digital sketching, playing with string, and interacting with clothes pins all form experiences that attempt to 'free' the mind surrounding more serious conversations. The intertwining of analog and digital experiences spoke to nostalgic moments that reminded participants of this type of play, in addition to speaking to the role of art in city building.</p>

  <p>I acted as one of the lead designers, alongside <a href="http://madeleineco.com/" target="_blank">Madeleine Co</a>, for this exhibition and installation, overlooking both physical and digital design.</p>
