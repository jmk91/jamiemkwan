<p>The CUBE Hotel is a modular structure that adapts to both the personal guest amenity requirements and the physical constraints of any given site. It can be deployed in small configurations, or pieced together to form a multi-unit complex of personalized suites at the core of destinations.</p>

<p>The CUBE Hotel attempts to redefine the way in which we think of ‘hospitality’. No more will a developer have to commit to a location where business is thriving one year and dwindling down the next. Through modular design, the CUBE Hotel adapts to the exact spatial needs of the guests as well as the spatial restrictions and conditions of its environment. A light-weight structure, it moves around on trucks, reconfiguring onto the newest popular place to travel - urban, natural, or in a remote uninhabitable location. Each unit integrates passive advertising in augmented reality with renewable energy sources for the hotel.</p>
