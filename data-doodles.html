	<p>This is a <a href="http://medium.com/data-doodles" target="_blank">journal of doodles</a> that capture a year of life for interdisciplinary designers, Zeynep Sen &amp; Jamie Kwan, as recorded in the moments of data that make up our lives. These are the stories between the lines of data; stories of living, of loving, of learning, and of letting go.</p>

	<p>For a year, we pledged to record and exchange data that made up a single week, resulting in 52 challenges each, in creatively visualizing our lives. We did this all in an effort to learn about data visualization, exercising sketching-just-for-fun, and in self-reflecting on our personal lives; drawing inspiration from Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec's award-winning project, <i>Dear Data</i>. </p>

	<p>Some of these weeks include:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A Week of Coffee;</li>    
    <li>A Week of Optimism;</li>
		<li>A Week of Distractions;</li>
    <li>A Week of Thank Yous;</li>
		<li>A Week of Family.</li>
	</ol>
