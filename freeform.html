    body-heading: Design Sprint Process
    body-text: Developed in a short two-week sprint, this experience design exercise allowed for an exploration into utilizing prototyping methods to tell a product story. Low-fidelity mockups were developed as a result of workshops that uncovered user needs and interaction modes, before a 'Kickstarter'-like video was developed to succinctly pitch the product's value. The business-case for this project was pitched in a separate exercise.

  <p>The biggest potential of 3D printing is its capacity for design democratization. We empower consumers to become active participants in the creation of their products by bridging the gap between 3D modelling and 3D printing, as well as the gap between 3D designers and consumers. </p>

  <p>Our mobile app uses parametric design (data-driven design) to make anyone a 3D designer, allowing for designs to be printed to personal specifications â€“ whether biometrics (perfect wearables) or just a personal keepsake!</p>
