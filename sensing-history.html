<p>Cultural museums today face interesting challenges: the preservation of artifacts, and the curation of experiences. With about 10% of artifacts ever on display, the impact of digital media has opened up the opportunities for digitization to allow for an open access to artifact collections, and the introduction of digital experiences. </p>

<p><b><span class="theme-color">In response to the visual nature of museums, this prototype exhibition aimed to use DIY methods of physical computing to create interactive reproductions of artifacts, that revealed digital stories and content upon discovery.</span></b> Sensory-based interactions -- smells released upon opening an object, holding an object for an extended period of time, holding and revealing an audio-based experience -- allowed visitors to use all of their senses to engage with artifact-specific stories and knowledge.</p>
